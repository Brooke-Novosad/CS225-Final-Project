For our meeting on Monday November 15th, we started by importing our data set into our Github repository. We then discussed the structure of our project, such as what classes and files we need. We decided on having a Graph class that holds an adjacency list. We also decided on creating separate classes for our shortest path algorithm and cycle detection algorithm. We outlined these classes and added them to our Github repository. We then divided up what tasks we would each be completing this week once our proposal gets approved. Our goals for the next two weeks are to parse the data and store it in our graph class. We also want to finish our Dijkstra’s and BFS implementations. Lastly, we will test our implementations as we write them.

Over the past two weeks we completed our tasks of parsing the data, calculating the weights, beginning Dijkstra’s implementation for shortest path, and beginning our BFS implementation. We also completed the Makefile in order to run main and test. As a group we wrote a few simple test cases to check our parsing of the data and weight calculation. We then spent some time discussing how the last two weeks went and things we could improve on to better our working experience. We decided we will start adding descriptive comments to our function and variables, write more specific commit messages, and fix variable naming to be easier understood by other group members. Brooke is going to continue working on Dijkstra’s and testing for Dijkstra’s. Jordan and Eunice will continue working on BFS and Serena will begin cycle detection. We also discussed 3 time slots for our Mid-Project Check in and emailed our mentor.

In the start of the meeting, we discussed the tour of Pennsylvania code. Serena wrote code to create a DFS tree in the graph class, which keeps track of the depth of each node. The tour finder does not guarantee that this is the longest path but it would return one of the longest paths. Serena and Brooke worked through the DJ algorithm and how it plays into the tour class where it is being utilized. Over the past week we have added numerous tests for almost every class with the exception of BFS and TourFinder. Jordan and Eunice will be adding tests for BFS this week and Serena will be adding tests for TourFinder. Brooke will work on the ReadMe File. Jordan and Eunice have been working on the BFS having too many nodes due to improper insertions. We realized that the graph is not entirely connected, we found out that our graph is in fact not connected, so we have been troubleshooting how to deal with that in our current classes, specifically BFS.We are going to meet this sunday december 12th at 1:00pm to make our video for the final project.

We started the meeting by catching up and updating each other on what we accomplished with the project this week. Brooke worked on the readme file and polished up some of the code, Serena finished up the tourfinder code and added tests, and Jordan and Eunice finished up BFS and added test cases. Everyone also polished up their code and added comments to their functions. Next, we worked on writing up the final report. We double checked our code to make sure everything looked good before we filmed our group presentation. We spent some time practicing and preparing for our final presentation and recorded over zoom. Brooke will put the final recording link in our github.
