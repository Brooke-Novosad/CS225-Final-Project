**Communication**

1. Team Meetings - We plan to meet once a week on Mondays at 3pm. We will meet in person for 1-2 hours. We will meet in the CIF and text about the location beforehand. We will have a note taker each week for the development log. The first note taker will be novosad3 and will go in a circle corresponding to the numbers later in this document. The note taker will type on a google doc what was discussed each week and who is assigned to what task. They will also submit the development log on github. Everyone will look over the paragraph and approve it at the start of the next meeting. 
2. Assistance - Our main point of contact will be through text. Email will also be available as well as calling. We will respond in 24 hours or less. 
3. Respect - The person who will be the note-taker on the following week will serve as the project lead for the current week. The project lead is responsible for making sure that everything is completed smoothly that week. She can fulfill her role by checking in on what each person is working on that week and making sure everyone is on the same page. For decision making, we will make decisions based on a Â¾ majority for voting. If we face a situation where we are split 50/50, we will flip a coin.

**Collaboration**

1. Work Distribution - Each week we will expect each member to complete a certain amount of work independently. We will split the work evenly and have members volunteer for which deliverables they want to complete. If no one volunteers, we will use a random number generator to decide who gets what. Serena will be number 4, Brooke will be number 3, Eunice is number 2, and Jordan is number 1. Everyone will be expected to work on their own parts, but are free to ask other members if they are stuck. 
2. Time Commitment - We will try to commit 2-6 hours every week to the final project. Even if we get busy with other reservations, we will still try our best to get our parts done. If anyone is having trouble completing their part that week, other members will reach out and see how they might try to help, such as helping code some of their parts. We will be understanding of each other's schedules, but if someone has an urgent matter of something that cannot be moved we will/ can work with them in order to have a harmonious and positive work environment. 
3. Conflict Resolution - If there cannot be an agreement made then we will have to discuss our reasoning for our choices more thoroughly. If something is very important to someone we will take that into consideration. If after that point we still cannot come to an agreement we will bring our TA or Professor Evans into the mix.
